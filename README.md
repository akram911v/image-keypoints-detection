# Image Keypoints Detection - Practical Work #2

## Detectors and Descriptors for Computer Vision

This project implements various keypoint detectors and descriptors for computer vision tasks, including feature detection, matching, and image analysis.

### Features
- **Multiple Detectors**: SIFT, ORB, BRISK
- **Keypoint Visualization**: Visual representation of detected features
- **Performance Comparison**: Analysis of different detectors
- **Image Matching**: Feature matching between images
- **Parameter Tuning**: Customizable detector parameters

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
